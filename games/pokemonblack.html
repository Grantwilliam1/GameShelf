            <p>PokÃ©mon Black Version and PokÃ©mon White Version are 2010 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by The PokÃ©mon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the PokÃ©mon video game series. First released in Japan on 18 September 2010, they were later released in Europe, North America and Australia in 2011. Sequels to Black and White, PokÃ©mon Black 2 and PokÃ©mon White 2, were released for the Nintendo DS in 2012.</p>
            <p>Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young trainer through the region of Unova, as they train PokÃ©mon used to compete against other trainers while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 156 new PokÃ©mon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder PokÃ©mon Red and Blue, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, triple battles, hidden abilities, and fully animated PokÃ©mon sprites. Both titles are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading PokÃ©mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' PokÃ©dex.</p>
